# ClarionWindowsLibrary
Wrapper for WIN32 API calls in Clarion. In an attempt to make them easier to add to multiple projects.

The general theme is implementing "namespaces" for the different aspects of the Windows Win32 api available in Clarion. Using the preface "WIN:" followed by more speficic classifications like "WIN:CON:" to access the methods pertaining to the Windows console.

This is not comprehensive, and I will only add functions as I need.
